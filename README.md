# Personalized prognosis prediction curves in allo-HCT

"Prognosis_prediction_curves_in_alloHCT.R" is the source code to develop an interactive web application for plotting personalized prognosis prediction curves in allo-HCT.
"PatientData.csv" is patients' data, but only column names are inputted into it now.

If each institute or society input its past patient data into "PatientData.csv" and run "Prognosis_prediction_curves_in_alloHCT.R", the web application using the predictive model developed by its data will be available.
